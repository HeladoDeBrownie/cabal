synopsis: Fix PATH changes not triggering REPL reconfiguration
packages: cabal-install
prs: #10817
issues: #2015

Previously, if you changed your PATH after initial configuration, Cabal would
continue using the old PATH settings in REPL sessions without warning.
With this fix, Cabal properly detects PATH changes and reconfigures the REPL
accordingly, ensuring tools and libraries in your current PATH are available.
While this may cause additional rebuilds when PATH changes, it prevents the
confusing errors that could occur when your REPL environment didn't match your
system configuration.
