The preprocessor hs-boot hack handles the situation in which a file to be
preprocessed is supplied alongside an hs-boot file, e.g. Foo.x and Foo.hs-boot
are given together.

This code now respects the --working-dir Cabal global argument. This fixes
build failures of the form:

  attempting to use module `Foo` (Foo.hs-boot) which is not loaded
