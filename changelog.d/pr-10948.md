synopsis: Make `Flag a` a type synonym for `Last (Maybe a)`
packages: Cabal cabal-install
prs: #10948

description: {

- Replace `data Flag a = Flag a | NoFlag` with `type Flag = Data.Monoid.Last`
  and provide `pattern Flag a = Last (Just a)` and `pattern NoFlag = Last Nothing`
  for backward compatibility.
- The change aims to be non-breaking for the majority of clients, although
  imports of form `import Distribution.Simple.Flag (Flag (..))` should be replaced
  with `import Distribution.Simple.Flag (Flag, pattern Flag, pattern NoFlag)`
  (the latter form is backwards compatible with older versions of Cabal).
  Enable language extension `PatternSynonyms` if required. In the unlikely case
  of defining instances for `Flag`, `TypeSynonymInstances` extension
  is needed.
